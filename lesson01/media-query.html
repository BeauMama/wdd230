                <p>
                    And if ye shall say there is ano law, ye shall also say there is no sin. If ye shall say there is no sin, ye shall also say there is no righteousness. 
                    And if there be no righteousness there be no happiness. And if there be no righteousness nor happiness there be no punishment nor misery. 
                    And if these things are not bthere is no God. And if there is no God we are not, neither the earth; for there could have been no creation of things, 
                    neither to act nor to be acted upon; wherefore, all things must have vanished away.
